## Introduction

[OGC API -- Processes](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/processes) is a standard that supports the wrapping of
computational tasks into executable processes that can be offered by a
server through a Web API and be invoked by a client application. The
standard specifies a processing interface to communicate over a RESTful
protocol using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) encodings. The standard
leverages concepts from the OGC Web Processing Service (WPS) 2.0
Interface Standard but does not require implementation of a WPS. The
Core part of the standard is called **OGC API - Processes - Part 1:
Core**. The Core part of the standard supports the wrapping of
computational tasks into executable processes that can be offered by a
server through a Web API and be invoked by a client application either
synchronously or asynchronously. Examples of computational processes
that can be supported by implementations of this specification include
raster algebra, geometry buffering, constructive area geometry, routing,
imagery analysis and several others.

!!! note
    This tutorial module is not intended to be a replacement to the actual
    **OGC API - Processes - Part 1: Core** standard. The tutorial
    intentionally focuses on a subset of capabilities in order to get the
    student started with using the standard. Please refer to the **OGC API -
    Processes - Part 1: Core** standard for additional detail.

### Background

> History

  Several of the concepts specified in OGC API - Processes originated in work specifying a RESTful interface for WPS 2.0. From February 2019 onwards, all work relating to a RESTful interface for the WPS2.0 was changed to focus on OGC API - Processes.

> Versions

  **OGC API - Processes - Part 1: Core** version 1.0.0 is the current latest version

> Test suite

  Test suites are available for:

  * OGC API - Processes - Part 1
  
  All of the test suites are available from the [OGC Validator](https://cite.ogc.org/teamengine/).

> Implementations

  Implementations can be found on the [implementations page](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-processes/blob/master/implementations.adoc).

#### Usage

**OGC API - Processes - Part 1: Core** supports the wrapping of
computational tasks into executable processes that can be offered by a
server through a Web API and be invoked by a client application.
Government agencies, private organisations and academic institutes use
the OGC API - Processes standard to provide implementations of
geospatial algorithms that process data. The benefit of this is that the
processing of geospatial data, including data from sensors, can be
distributed thereby allowing for more capacity to process larger amounts
of data.

In addition to the approved part above, The OGC API - Processes Standards Working Group (SWG) is working on the following drafts:

* *Draft* **OGC API - Processes - Part 2: Deploy, Replace, Undeploy** extends the core capabilities specified in Part 1 with the ability to dynamically add, modify and/or delete individual processes using an implementation (endpoint) of the OGC API - Processes Standard.
  
* *Draft* **OGC API - Processes - Part 3: Workflows and Chaining** extends the core capabilities specified in Part 1 with the ability to chain nested processes, refer to both local and external processes and collections of data accessible via OGC API standards as inputs to a process, and trigger execution of processes through OGC API data delivery specifications such as OGC API — Tiles, DGGS, Coverages, Features, EDR and Maps.

#### Relation to other OGC Standards

-   OGC Web Processing Service Interface Standard (WPS): The WPS
    Standard provides a standard interface that simplifies the task of
    making simple or complex computational geospatial processing
    services accessible via web services. The OGC API --- Processes
    Standard is a newer and more modern way of programming and
    interacting with resources over the web while allowing better
    integration into existing software packages. The OGC
    API --- Processes Standard addresses all of the use cases that were
    addressed by the WPS Standard, while also leveraging the OpenAPI
    specification and a resource-oriented approach.

### Example

This [demonstration](https://demo.pygeoapi.io/master) server offers and executes various processes through an interface that conforms to OGC API - Processes.

An example request that can be used to browse all the available processes can be found at <https://demo.pygeoapi.io/master/processes>.

Note that the response to the request is HTML in this case.

Alternatively, the same data can be retrieved in GeoJSON format, through the request https://demo.pygeoapi.io/master/processes?f=json

## Resources

### Landing page

Given OGC API - Processes uses OGC API - Common and OGC API - Features as building blocks, please see the [OGC API - Features](features.md#landing-page) deep dive
for a detailed explanation.

### Conformance declarations

Given OGC API - Processes uses OGC API - Common and OGC API - Features as building blocks, please see the [OGC API - Features](features.md#conformance-declarations) deep dive
for a detailed explanation.

### API Definition

Given OGC API - Processes OGC API - Common as a building block, please see the [OGC API - Features](features.md#api-definition) deep dive
for a detailed explanation of an example implementation.

### Process list

Processes offered through an implementation of **OGC API - Processes** are organized into one or more processes.  The `/processes`
endpoint provides information about and access to the list of processes.

For each process, there is a link to the detailed description of the 
process (represented by the path **/processes/{processId}** and 
link relation **self**).  In addition, there are links for executing the
process as well as the list of jobs as a results of executing the process.

Process information also includes whether the process can be run in synchronous
and / or asynchronous mode (job control options).  Asynchronous mode is valuable
for executing long running jobs without blocking the HTTP request/response workflow.
This also means the client can check back for the status of the job as well as the
result once it is completed.

Finally, there are definitions for the input structure required to run the process
(expressed as JSON Schema), as well as the output structure a client should expect
when receiving a response from the process execution.

        "value"

}
```

### Process description

The previous example demonstrated process information for all processes offered by an OGC API - Processes
server.  To access process information for a single process, run the below request against the demo server:

<https://demo.pygeoapi.io/master/processes/hello-world?f=json>

!!! note
    Single process information requires the process identifier as part of the URL

### Process execution

Now that we have the appropriate process information, we can execute the process.  Process execution
requires that requests are run using HTTP POST, with a payload as specified/required by the server (JSON).

!!! note
    Web browsers cannot easily make HTTP POST requests, so we use the [curl](https://curl.se) command.
    You are welcome to use any tool that is able to execute HTTP POST requests per below.

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'https://demo.pygeoapi.io/master/processes/hello-world/execution' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "inputs": {
    "message": "Great to see you here",
    "name": "OGC API workshop participant"
  }
}'
```

The server will respond with an immediate response (synchronous mode by default) as per below:

```json
{
    "id": "echo",
    "value": "Hello OGC API workshop participant! Great to see you here"
}
```

To execute the same process in asynchronous mode, we need to add the **Prefer: respond-async**
HTTP header.  As well, the response to an ascynchronous process execution is always empty, where
the HTTP **Location** header contains a URL to the resulting job information.


!!! note
    We add the `-v` option to the curl command below to be able to inspect the response headers

```bash
curl -v -X 'POST' \
  'https://demo.pygeoapi.io/master/processes/hello-world/execution' \
  -H 'Prefer: respond-async' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "inputs": {
    "message": "Great to see you here",
    "name": "OGC API workshop participant"
  }
}'
```

An extract of the response shows the **Location** (location) HTTP header:

```bash
< HTTP/2 201 
< access-control-allow-origin: *
< content-language: en-US
< content-type: application/json
< date: Mon, 04 Dec 2023 16:33:06 GMT
< location: https://demo.pygeoapi.io/master/jobs/cdbc641c-92c2-11ee-9c88-0242ac120003
< preference-applied: respond-async
< server: gunicorn
< x-powered-by: pygeoapi 0.16.dev0
< content-length: 4
```

!!! note
    The URL of the `location` HTTP header will always be unique

### Job status info

Using the URL from the `location` HTTP header above, we can inspect the status of the job:

<https://demo.pygeoapi.io/master/jobs/cdbc641c-92c2-11ee-9c88-0242ac120003?f=json>

```json
{
    "processID": "hello-world",
    "jobID": "cdbc641c-92c2-11ee-9c88-0242ac120003",
    "status": "successful",
    "message": "Job complete",
    "progress":100,
    "parameters":null,
    "job_start_datetime": "2023-12-04T16:33:06.806485Z",
    "job_end_datetime": "2023-12-04T16:33:06.812615Z",
    "links":[
        {
            "href": "https://demo.pygeoapi.io/master/jobs/cdbc641c-92c2-11ee-9c88-0242ac120003/results?f=html",
            "rel": "about",
            "type": "text/html",
            "title": "results of job cdbc641c-92c2-11ee-9c88-0242ac120003 as HTML"
        },
        {
            "href": "https://demo.pygeoapi.io/master/jobs/cdbc641c-92c2-11ee-9c88-0242ac120003/results?f=json",
            "rel": "about",
            "type": "application/json",
            "title": "results of job cdbc641c-92c2-11ee-9c88-0242ac120003 as JSON"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Job results

Here we see that the job is fully executed and complete, but does not contain the actual results.  To inspect
the actual results, we use the link objects which provide the results accordingly:

<https://demo.pygeoapi.io/master/jobs/cdbc641c-92c2-11ee-9c88-0242ac120003/results?f=json>

!!! note
    We see that the the results of the synchronous and asynchronous request/responses are identical, and
    that only the execution control is different.


### Job list

In the same manner that an OGC API - Proceses server provides access to process information for all its
processes, the server provides the same for all of its jobs (from any process) using the following URL:

<https://demo.pygeoapi.io/master/jobs?f=json>

### Job deletion

If we wish to delete a given job, we can execute an HTTP DELETE request agains the the job ID.

!!! note
    Web browsers cannot easily make HTTP DELETE requests, so we use the [curl](https://curl.se) command.
    You are welcome to use any tool that is able to execute HTTP DELETE requests per below.

```bash
curl -X 'DELETE' https://demo.pygeoapi.io/master/jobs/cdbc641c-92c2-11ee-9c88-0242ac120003
```

!!! note
    Try running an HTTP GET on the job that was just deleted and verify that it no longer exists (HTTP 404).

!!! note
    Some servers may implement access control to prevent erroneous or unwanted deletion of a job or
    other resource.

## Summary

The OGC API - Processes standard enables the execution of computing processes and the retrieval of metadata describing the purpose and functionality of the processes. This deep dive provided an introduction to the standard and an overview of its various endpoints, that enable monitoring, creating, updating and deleting those processes on a server.
